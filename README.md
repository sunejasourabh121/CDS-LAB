# To study and implement C++ 2D Array - Matrices
## AIM
To study and implement C++ 2D array matrices
## THEORY
Matrices in C++ are represented as 2D arrays. They are used to store and manipulate data in a structured, tabular form.

Introduction to Matrices
A matrix is a collection of elements arranged in rows and columns.
In C++, matrices are typically implemented using 2D arrays.

Declaring a Matrix
syntax for declaring a 2D array (matrix)
```
data_type matrix_name[rows][columns];
```
Initializing a Matrix
for eg
```
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```
Accessing Elements of a Matrix
Elements of a matrix are accessed using row and column indices.
For eg
```
int value = matrix[1][2];
```
Addition of matrices :
To add two matrices in C++, you can use a nested loop structure to iterate through each element of the matrices and add corresponding elements.
i) Matrix Size Input: The program asks for the number of rows and columns to define the size of the matrices.
ii) Matrix Elements Input: It then prompts the user to enter the elements for the two matrices.
iii) Matrix Addition: The program adds the corresponding elements of the two matrices.
iv) Output: Finally, it prints the result .

Subtraction of matrices
i) The program first asks the user to input the number of rows and columns for the matrices.
ii) It then prompts the user to input the elements for both matrices.
iii) The subtraction is performed by iterating through each element of the matrices and subtracting the corresponding elements.
iv) The resultant matrix is then printed on the screen.
## CODE AND OUTPUT

    }
    for(k-0; k<3; k++){
        for (l=0;l<3;l++){
            cout<<temp[k][l];
            cout<<" ";
    }
    cout <<endl;

## CONCLUSION
This experiment provides valuable insight into fundamental concepts in programming, particularly in handling data structures that require multi-dimensional organization. Through this process, we gain a deeper understanding of how to:

1.Efficiently Store and Manipulate Data: Using 2D arrays, we can efficiently store data in a tabular format, making it easier to perform operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.

2.Develop Problem-Solving Skills: Implementing matrix operations enhances logical thinking and problem-solving skills, as it requires careful consideration of indices, loops, and data handling.

3.Understand Memory Management: Working with 2D arrays in C++ also provides an understanding of how memory is allocated and accessed in programming, especially in managing rows and columns of data.

4.Apply Concepts in Real-World Scenarios: Matrix operations are fundamental in various fields such as engineering, computer graphics, machine learning, and scientific computing. Understanding how to implement these in C++ prepares us to tackle more complex problems in these domains.
