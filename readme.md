## C++ Inheritance: Overview and Types

Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class. This promotes code reusability, extendability, and hierarchical classification.

## Types of Inheritance

- **Single Inheritance**:
  - A derived class inherits from a single base class.

- **Multiple Inheritance**:
  - A derived class inherits from more than one base class.

- **Multilevel Inheritance**:
  - A class is derived from another derived class, forming a multi-level hierarchy.

- **Hierarchical Inheritance**:
  - Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

- **Hybrid Inheritance**:
  - A combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

## Access Specifiers in Inheritance

The access specifier used during inheritance determines the accessibility of base class members in the derived class. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

| Access Specifier | Base Class Public Members | Base Class Protected Members | Base Class Private Members |
|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Public**       | Public in Derived Class     | Protected in Derived Class   | Not Directly Accessible    |
| **Protected**    | Protected in Derived Class | Protected in Derived Class   | Not Directly Accessible    |
| **Private**      | Not Accessible             | Not Accessible                | Not Accessible             |

### Key Points

- **Public Inheritance**:
  - Public members of the base class remain public in the derived class.
  - Protected members remain protected.
  - Private members are not directly accessible but can be accessed via public/protected methods.

- **Protected Inheritance**:
  - Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.

- **Private Inheritance**:
  - Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class.

## Abstract Classes

- **Abstract Class**:
  - A class containing at least one pure virtual function (e.g., `virtual void func() = 0;`).
  - Cannot be instantiated directly.
  - Designed to be inherited by other classes.

## Benefits of Inheritance

- **Code Reusability**: Allows reuse of existing code.
- **Extendability**: Facilitates the addition of new features with minimal changes.
- **Polymorphism**: Supports the creation of more flexible and extensible systems by allowing derived classes to override base class methods.
